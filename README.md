# Description

Flox Dont Stop is a cooperative endless climber that meshes strategic platform placement with careful character maneuvering. This game has been developed by myself and 5 other awesome people and is currently in development for a Steam release. You can check out the prototype made in two weeks on [Itch.io](https://gatlincasey.itch.io/flox-dont-stop) if you'd like to download an play the game.

# Contributions

For this project I've programmed the camera movement, an asynchronous loading screen, and have set up the player movement and controls in C++.
